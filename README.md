# Optimization Techniques

This repository contains the laboratory work for the Optimization Techniques course. We addressed linear, nonlinear, and convex optimization problems, both with and without constraints, using various gradient methods (classic, stochastic, projected) implemented from scratch, and in some cases, solvers from packages like SciPy and CVXPY. 
The problems ranged from purely theoretical applications, such as filtering synthetic time series (Hodrick-Prescott filter, $\ell_1$), and classification with SVM, to the formulation and solving of minimization problems in practical contexts, such as optimizing transportation for stock distribution between locations or image denoising.
